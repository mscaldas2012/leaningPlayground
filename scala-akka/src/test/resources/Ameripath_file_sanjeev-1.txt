An immunoperoxidase stain for Melan-A was performed with appropriately reactive controls.  This stain highlights the in situ melanoma as well as large nests of melanocytes in the dermis.  At the base of the lesion, there are scattered small nests and individual melanocytes.   2.  Some junctional nests protrude into the dermis, however, there are islands of atypical cells with no apparent connection to the epidermis, which are interpreted as invasive melanoma.  There appears to be an associated banal dermal nevus component.  Re-excision is recommended.  The findings have been reported and faxed to Erin in Dr. Rydzik's office (07/09/2013). 3.  An additional board certified dermatopathologist, Dr. Christopher Erickson, has reviewed the case.\par \fs24\ul0\cf1\par}||||||F||||03D0980494^Dermpath Diagnostics Tucson^CLIA|||
