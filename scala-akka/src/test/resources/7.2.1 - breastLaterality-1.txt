OBX|3|FT|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN||Sections from the generously sampled skin and breast tissue confirm the presence of two cutaneous scars with an underlying healing biopsy cavity. The biopsy cavity is lined by granulation tissue with areas of scarring, vascular congestion, hemorrhage, resolving fat necrosis, foreign body type granulomatous inflammation with suture granulomas and scattered hemosiderin laden macrophages. Around the biopsy cavity (in blocks A15, A16, A18 and A19), few small foci of residual DCIS, atypical ductal hyperplasia and florid usual ductal hyperplasia are present, some of which are associated with microcalcifications. The DCIS is low to intermediate grade, solid and cribriform type and the largest focus in block A16 measures 5.6 mm. Since an inked margin is not seen in any of these blocks, the DCIS is likely distant from all the margins. Definite microinvasion, invasive carcinoma and lymphovascular invasion is not identified. \.br\\.br\Sections from the grossly identified fibrotic lesion adjoining the biopsy cavity (submitted in toto in block A3 to A10) shows benign breast tissue with dense fibrous stroma, a large thrombosed vessel in block A6 and microcalcifications in few benign terminal duct lobular units. There is no in situ and invasive carcinoma. The remaining breast tissue shows few benign and apocrine cysts, a benign intraductal papilloma with apocrine metaplasia, and microcalcifications in few benign terminal duct lobular units. The nipple areolar complex is unremarkable. \.br\||||||F|
